After conclusion of experiments, mouse remains will need to be incinerated and bedding autoclaved prior to disposal. Isolators after use will be soaked in Clidox disinfectant, re-assembled, and autoclaved prior to re-use. Animal work outside of the V3 facility will be conducted in the secured rooms of the Hsiao lab in Webber Hall. This will involve suckling animals, which will be inoculated with bacterial mixtures and kept at 30C in an incubator for no more than 16hrs post infection.
