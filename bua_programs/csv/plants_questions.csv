1,False,,False,,True,"Agrobacterium tumefaciens are used as a host for a Transfer DNA (T-DNA) plasmid. The plasmid that is used has been disarmed and is not capable of causing crown gall disease. Nevertheless, lab practices include autoclaving of all materials contaminated with these bacterium prior to disposal. Similarly, infection with A. rhizogenes for transfer of the R-plasmid is with strains that do not pose environmental concerns.",False,,False,,False,
2,False,,False,,True,"Tomato or Arabidopsis plant roots or various fruits will be inoculated using a F. oxysporum microconidial suspension in a ClassII, Type A/B3 Biosafety cabinet. The plants will then be planted in minipots, placed in trays (using the biosafety cabinet or workstation) and transferred to a growth chamber for incubation. Plants will be observed for disease symptoms for 3-5 weeks in the growth chamber. All irrigation water will be collected and treated with bleach to decontaminate. The flats used to contain irrigation water will be decontaminated using bleach. F. oxysporum-infected plant material and pots and soil will be autoclaved prior to disposal. In most experiments F. oxysporum-infected plants will be autoclaved prior to the onset of spore formation. In cases where sporulation may occur, infected plants will be placed in an enclosed container and the container and plant will be autoclaved after the experiment.",False,,False,,False,

4,True,"Agrobacterium rhizogenes, Agrobacterium radiobacter, Sinorhizobium rhizogenes, and Xanthomonas axonopodis all cause ""hairy root disease"". Any infected plant material will be autoclaved prior to disposal.",False,,False,,False,,False,,False,
5,True,"Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis' host specificity is strictly limited to the a small number of special lab strains of the model lab plant Arabidopsis thaliana. It is very unlikely to spreadin natural Arabidopsis thaliana. poplulations found in theU.S. and it cannot spread to other plant species. Agrobacerium is only used as a transfection agent. Pseudomonas and Botrytis are used only rarely to induce immune responses in plants. Their use is limited to our biosafety cabinet, and these pathogens are present in our local environment.",False,,False,,False,,False,,False,
6,True,"All the bacterial fungal culture and all the infected plants will be autoclaved and bleach sterilized before discard. The plant infection will only be conducted in a specific location (Green house 12 plant growthroom inner-room). The room will be bleach sterilized after each batch of infection. Since the VIGS is a transient assay, the VIGS effect can not pass onto the next generation. Although it creats problems for our genetic study, it provides another level of safety protection. Although all the P. infestans and Botrytis strains will be used in this study are California strains, detached leaf assay will still be used and the biosafety cabinet in Dr. Eulgem lab in Genomics 3229A (The filter certification date is on 11/22/11) will be used. The collaboration has been arranged. All handling of transgenic pathogens and infected plants will take place in the biosafety cabinet, growth rooms and the",True,"TRV, Partial plant gene DNA fragment will be inserted into TRV vector for inducing gene silencing. Botrytis will be mutated to reduce its virulence. We use recombinant DNA tech to alter the small RNAs and genes in Botrytis. Plants will be exposed to transgenic Botrytis.",False,,False,,False,,False,
7,True,"While most experiments will involve strains of P. infestans native to California, some may involve strains imported from other states/countries. All experiments with exotic strains are done in sealed plastic containers in growth chambers or incubators to prevent release.",True,"Some infection assays will involve P. infestans strains in which genes thought to be important for spore function will be impaired, or in which a reporter gene such as green fluorescent protein is expressed. This is expected to have no effect on virulence or will reduce virulence.",False,,False,,False,,False,
8,True,"All the microorganisms in my laboratory are handled with care in the biosafety cabinets (BSL-2). Plants infected with Pseudomonas syringae or Phytophthora species will be contained in domes in growth facilities (growth chambers or growth rooms) in the Genomics building with lockable doors. The infected plants (including soil) will be autoclaved before disposal. The pots, trays and domes are soaked in 10% bleach first and then washed by detergent.",True,"Once a pathogen gene involved in disease development is identified, the gene function will be studied by plant infection assays using genetically modified pathogen or transgenic plants expressing the pathogen genes. The genetically modified pathogen strains include those with the gene of interest either knocked out or over-expressed in a ""wild-type"" strain. These mutants and the infected plants will be handled with care in the same way as described above. To generate plants expressing the pathogen genes, Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying the genes of interest will be used to introduce the genes into Nicotiana benthamiana or Arabidopsis. Disease symptoms and plant defense response will be examined in the transgenic plants. The seeds of the transgenic plants will be securely stored and the infected plants will be autoclaved after each experiment.",False,,False,,False,,False,
9,True,"The pathogen host are plants that are grown in California so any dissemination will be negative. The pathogen strains will be contain in the lab and the experiments will be done in the lab and in the growth chambers. All contaminated material will be confined, contained and autoclaved to destroy any material containing the agents.",True,Potato Virus X genome is clone into AGrobacterium and the virus has been modified with a gene encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP) for rapid visualization in the plant. The virulence of this strain is the same as the wild type strain. The Pst DC3000 have been modified to have the luciferase operon (LuxCDABE) to produce bioluminescence that can be detected in plants with especial equipment to monitor the disease progress. The virulence of this Pst DC3000 LuxCDABE is the same than the Wild type strain. When the protocol for Phythophthora cinnamomi genetic transformation is developed and available to the public we will modified this pathogen for functional genomic studies.,False,,False,,False,,False,
