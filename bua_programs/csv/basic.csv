This process is catalyzed by the Mn4CaO5 cluster in Photosystem II and provides nearly our entire supply of atmospheric oxygen. The Mn4CaO5 cluster accumulates oxidizing equivalents in response to light-driven photochemical events within Photosystem II and then oxidizes two molecules of water to oxygen in the final step of a five-step cycle. Water oxidation is an extremely difficult chemical reaction, both thermodynamically and kinetically, yet the Mn4Ca cluster catalyzes this reaction far more efficiently than any synthetic catalyst. The reason is that nature carefully designed the protein environment of the Mn4CaO5 cluster. This environment controls the cluster's reactivity at each step in the catalytic cycle by carefully choreographing the proton and electron transfer reactions associated with water oxidation and by carefully managing both substrate (water) access and proton egress. The project's primary goal is to identify the amino acid residues that are responsible for this control and to determine the role of each. This information is crucial to understanding the mechanism of O2 production in Photosystem II and will complement information that is being obtained from X-ray crystallography. The projects primary investigative tool is infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The projects primary aims are to further delineate the dominant water access and proton egress pathways that link the Mn4CaO5 cluster with the thylakoid lumen and to characterize the influence of specific residues on the water molecules that serve as substrate or as participants in the networks of hydrogen bonds that make up the water access and proton egress pathways. Both FTIR difference spectroscopy and time-resolved IR spectroscopy are being conducted with mutant Photosystem II core complexes representing residues identified crystallographically or computationally as potentially participating in networks of hydrogen bonds or otherwise interacting with the Mn4CaO5 cluster and the water molecules in its immediate environment. Identifying these residues and further delineating the networks of hydrogen bonds that form water access and proton egress channels will improve our understanding of the dynamic mechanism of water oxidation by the Mn4CaO5 catalyst in PSII and will provide insight into the design of new generations of synthetic catalysts that convert sunlight into useful forms of storable energy.","The environment of the manganese cluster in Photosystem II is made up of amino acid residues from two specific polypeptide chains.

Significant work has focused on developing a basic knowledge of Al toxicity and resistance and at the same time devising schemes to modify crop plants to allow them to thrive in such an inhospitable environment, yet our understanding of the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying Al toxicity and resistance remain limited. Our work utilizes a previously described Al-sensitive Arabidopsis mutant, als3-1, to identify mutations that can be used to confer increases in Al resistance/tolerance. Since als3-1 has been found to have extreme negative responses to levels of Al that have no effect on growth of wild type roots, this mutant is a powerful tool to allow us to easily identify suppressor mutations that give increased Al resistance and to successfully use a map-based cloning approach to isolate the mutations of interest. We have undertaken an approach whereby als3-1 has been treated with the mutagenic agent EMS and M1 seedlings have been screened to identify mutants capable of sustaining wt or greater root growth in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of Al. From this approach, 15 confirmed strong alt (Al tolerant) mutants have been identified, with roots of these at the very least fully reversing the severe affects of Al toxicity on growth of als3-1. Of the 15 strong alt mutants, at least 9 of these have been found to represent dominant mutations, suggesting that these represent gain-of-function mutations that may positively affect a documented mechanism of Al resistance such as organic acid release, rhizosphere alkalinization, or Al sequestration. Our work focuses initially on cloning five of the alt mutations. Following isolation of the mutations, we will subsequently work to characterize the ALT genes with regard to their roles in Al resistance/tolerance using relevant biochemical, molecular, and physiological tools. Additionally, our work has focused on identifying mutations that can increase Al resistance associated with malate release into the rhizosphere. This has resulted in identification of multiple mutations that improve the function and activity of a key carbon fixation step in plants, Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. This enzyme is important to several processes including C4 photosynthesis and amino acid biosynthesis. As part of our research to translate our findings into crop plants, our alr mutations will be introduced into PPC's found in maize in order to determine whether these will increase carbon fixation in the transgenic plants.","Some of the objectives of this work focus on cloning and characterization of the mutations of interest.

There are three main research projects ongoing in the laboratory 1. Revealing mechanisms controlling gene expression in the Apicomplexan parasites Mechanisms controlling gene expression in Apicomplexan parasites are still poorly understood. Rising evidences indicate that control of gene expression in the malaria parasites occurs at multiple levels, one of those being chromatin remodeling. It is increasingly apparent that histone turnover and histone post-translational modifications are important in chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation. Determination of chromatins structural changes will therefore be critical for the understanding of transcriptional regulation in Apicomplexan parasites including human malaria parasites . Using genome wide complementary approaches. we are investigating the parasite dynamic chromatin structure and the molecular components that regulate their features. 2. Drug discovery and natural products In addition to fundamental scientific approaches, we are developing drug-screening assays and high content live cell confocal imaging technologies to identify small molecule inhibitors and their morphological effects on the Apicomplexan parasites. Ongoing collaborations with several institutes are providing us with a comprehensive array of natural products. So far we have already uncovered several compounds that can inhibit malaria growth in the low nano molar ranges. Experiments to identify drug targets and drug mechanism of actions are still ongoing. 3  Detection of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in mosquitoes to improve surveillance of emerging mosquito borne diseases in California.

Our focus is on flower and fruit diversity and the evolutionary changes in the genes that determine flower and fruit morphology. Our work centers on two closely related plant development genes, AP1 and FUL. In Arabidopsis, both are required for proper flower development, but AP1 is also required for sepals and petals to form, whereas FUL is important in the development of the dry capsule-like fruit of Arabidopsis. AP1 and FUL arose from a gene duplication, and although their sequences are similar, there are short amino acid motifs that distinguish them, and their expression patterns are different. We are interested in whether the observed differences in function are the result of the different amino acid motifs or the differences in expression. We will be growing transgenic Arabidopsis (produced in another lab) which contain constructs with mutations that disrupt the amino acid motifs or that alter gene expression to answer this question. We may also make crosses with other Arabidopsis mutants. We are also investigating the role of FUL genes in fruit development in the tomato family. Many members of this family produce seeds in a dry pod-like fruit whereas others produce a fleshy edible fruit. We are interested in the role of changes in FUL function in the development of dry and fleshy fruit and will be comparing gene function in tomato and desert tobacco, which has a capsule-type fruit. These species both have four copies of the FUL gene. to investigate the origin of all these copies we are amplifying FUL genes from a variety of species in the family, from the earliest diverging members to the most advanced, and are cloning them into E. coli for sequencing. We will be looking at the number of genes as well as their sequences, to determine if any of the four groups of FUL genes has evolved more slowly or quickly. We will also be using agrobacterium-mediated CRISPR technology to knock out each gene individually (four in tomato, four in desert tobacco) using a tissue-culture process. The four genes fall into two pairs, euFULI and euFULII, and we will either use CRISPR or make crosses to make double mutants, and finally quadruple knock-outs. The goal is to determine if there are functional differences between euFULI and euFULII genes, and to determine if there are redundant functions that can only be uncovered if all are knocked out. Our goal is to understand how changes in FUL function may have contributed to the evolution of fleshy fruit from dry fruit in this family.","None of the materials are particularly hazardous, but the goals are: (1) transgenic E. coli - our procedure to amplify FUL genes from tomato-family members will produce product containing multiple different gene sequences. To separate these and identify the ones relevant for us, we will clone the amplification product into E. coli and sequence plasmids that may contain a FUL gene. We will use these sequences in analyses to identify when duplications occurred, and to analyze sequence evolution. This may help us determine that specific groups of FUL genes may have undergone functional changes, or that changes in gene sequence are correlated with the origin of fleshy fruit from dry fruit. (2) transgenic Agrobacterium - will be generated to introduce CRISPR-Cas9 constructs into tomato and desert tobacco to knock out the function of FUL genes to characterize their function in fruit and flower development. (3) transgenic tomato and desert tobacco - we will be using CRISPR to knock out each of the four FUL genes separately, and will also look at double and quadruple mutants. (4) transgenic Datura - we are working on developing a transformation system for this species, which independently evolved a dry fruit, to expand the scope of our study. We will characterize the function of FUL genes in dry and fleshy fruit development, which will help elucidate how fleshy fruit, which are economically and ecologically important, arose from dry fruit during the course of the evolution of the tomato family.

Our research projects focus on the molecular mechanisms by which cells regulate p53 transcriptional activity in response to DNA damage. The p53 tumor suppressor protein plays an important role in the cellular response to stress such as DNA damage. The biochemical activity of p53 that is required for this relies on its ability to bind to specific DNA sequences and to function as a transcription factor . Recently, we identified Thr-55 as a novel phosphorylation site on human p53 and showed that TAFI, the largest subunit of transcription factor TFIID complex, is responsible for the phosphorylation. TAFI is identical to CCG1, a cell cycle regulatory protein important for progression through the G1 phase and apoptosis. We observed that the phosphorylation of Thr55 by TAFI results in p53 degradation and leads to a decrease in G1 arrest. Importantly, the Thr55 phosphorylation was much reduced following DNA damage, which suggests that this phosphorylation contributes to the stabilization of p53 in response to DNA damage. Thus, phosphorylation by TAFI and the resultant destabilization of p53 provide a novel mechanism for regulation of the cell cycle in response to DNA damage. We propose to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which TAFI regulates the stability of p53 in response to DNA damage. First, we will identify the domains of TAFI required for p53 interaction and phosphorylation and we will examine whether TAFI double bromodomains (DBrD) are required for the interaction. Second, we will further characterize the role of Thr55 phosphorylation in TAFI-mediated cell G1 progression and apoptosis. Third, as p53 is a DNA-bound transcription activator and TAFI is a component of general transcription machinery, we will examine whether phosphorylation of p53 by TAFI occurs during the act of transcription. Fourth, we will define the underlying molecular mechanisms of Thr55","For this amendment, we include lentivirus in our research.

The principal approach used in this research has been to make bioinformatic-based guesses for the encoding gene and then transgenically express these candidate moss genes in tobacco.

This structure is thought to allow telomeres to act as chromosome caps that maintain genomic stability by protecting chromosome ends from degradation and inappropriate recombination events. Consistent with this idea, disruption of telomere function correlates with increased incidence of tumor formation in mice and the formation of gross chromosomal rearrangements. Our long-term objective is to understand the processes critical throughout the cell cycle for maintaining the capping function of telomeres. The goal of this proposal is to understand the function of a set of genes, CDC13, STN1, and TEN1, which are critical for maintaining telomere integrity in S. cerevisiae. The prevailing model for the function of CDC13 is that it acts as a physical cap, preventing nucleolytic degradation of one DNA strand by binding specifically to terminal single-stranded sequences at telomeres. However, an alternate model that this proposal examines is that CDC13 primarily functions to promote complete replication of terminal DNA sequences. The lab is testing the hypothesis that Cdc13p, Stn1p, and Ten1p form a multi-protein complex that is required to promote replication of telomeres by both conventional polymerases and telomerase.

Finally we would like to investigate the mechanisms underlying nervous system development and function. Most animals can detect and discriminate between a wide variety of odorants and sensory cues which are critical for a number of behaviors like finding food, mating, and oviposition. Odor molecules are detected by 7-transmembrane Odor Receptor proteins present on the surface of neurons in the olfactory organs. Several genes, including large family of olfactory receptor genes are involved in genomes of several other insect species. Every behavior as well as odor responses of individual receptors and other genes can be analyzed in detail using an array of powerful molecular, genetic, bioinformatic and physiological means. Our lab will employ these approaches to address a number of important problems in neuroscience. 1. The molecular basis of chemosensation in insects. Insects like mosquitoes, tsetse flies, sand flies, house flies and ticks carry a large number of debilitating diseases like malaria, yellow fever, dengue, lymphatic filariasis, river blindness, african sleeping sickness, chagas disease, plague, west nile virus and typhus. Many insect vectors of disease find their human hosts through the sense of smell. We will study the function of odor receptor genes from these species to better understand the molecular basis of insect-host attraction. Identification of odor receptors that guide insect - host and insect - insect interactions will provide us with new opportunities in pest control. We will employ high-throughput laboratory based functional assays to identify volatile compounds that can activate, inhibit or block odor receptors very efficiently. These compounds will be tested for behavior modifying effects and for usefulness as trapping agents, repellents, or masking agents. A large amount of agricultural crops and stored produce are consumed by insects like flies, moths and beetles. Many of these agricultural pests locate their food using olfactory cues. We will study the function of odor receptor genes from these insects to better understand the molecular basis of host attraction. 2.

The immediate goals are to determine the mechanism of action of one critical liver-enriched transcription factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4a (HNF4a) and other nuclear receptors. Found primarily in the liver, kidney, intestine and pancreas, HNF4a is a highly conserved member of the superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors (nuclear receptors) that regulates many target genes essential to basic metabolism as well as xenobiotic and drug metabolism. HNF4a has been linked to several human diseases including hemophilia, diabetes, atherosclerosis and cancer via regulation of hepatitis B viral genes and P450 (cyp) genes. HNF4a is also known to be an essential gene in organisms ranging from insect to man and to be essential for the adult liver phenotype. Despite the obvious importance of HNF4a, much remains to be elucidated about its mechanism of action. To address this, our lab studies various aspects of HNF4-related biology, including interacting proteins, post-translational modifications and responses to environmental signals, ligand and target genes. HNF4a is a member of the superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors (nuclear receptors). It interacts with several other receptors and regulates the expression of others.  A related project in the lab deals with other nuclear receptors with which we define their DNA binding specificity and target genes. Those receptors are expressed in Cos7 cells and the proteins are extracted and analyzed. Mouse tissues and human cell lines expressing endogenous nuclear receptors are also used.","To study the mechanism by which the liver-enriched transcription factor HNF4 regulates gene expression. We analyze lipophilic compounds such as fatty acids that bind HNF4, interacting proteins and phosphorylation of HNF4.We also identify the genes that are regulated by HNF4a and the proteins that regulate HNF4a function. To accomplish this we routinely transfect HNF4 and other cDNAs in mammalian and/or insect cell lines and transform HNF4 and other cDNAs in bacteria for expression of protein. We use recombinant adenovirus and lentivirus to express nuclear receptors and other factors in cell lines that are difficult to transfect with plasmids.

Work with human subjects will involve collecting electronic cigarette aerosol exhalation for analysis of chemical exposure related to the use of these devices. The specific aim of this project is to derive human embryonic stem cells (HESCs) at earlier stages of development, then the currently existing HESCs, which have been derived from the internal cell mass (ICM) of the blastocysts. Currently existing HESCs are already primed to differentiate to a particular lineage. (They are called primed HESCs.) This impedes the use of existing HESCs for consistent differentiation to lineages of all three germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm). In addition, it increases the cost for establishing a specific differentiation protocols for each line.

A better understanding of pluripotency, reprogramming and the signals for commitment to differentiation requires more research.
