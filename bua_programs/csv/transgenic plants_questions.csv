,Is your transgenic organism expressing a cloned gene(s) from Pahkospora pachyrhizi (soybean rust fungus) or Maize streak virus or any other exotic (not found in CA) infectious agent that could negatively impact the environment if released?,If “yes” please describe any potential impact on the environment and the precautions taken to prevent release.,Does your transgenic plant express the complete genome of a non-exotic infectious agent (no recognized danger for rapid or widespread dissemination or detrimental impact on ecosystems)? Examples: Agrobacterium or Rhizobium.,"If “yes,” please describe",Are you using 2/3 if the functional genome of the infectious agent?,"Is your transgenic plant a noxious weed? For more information and a list of noxious weeds, please see aphisweb.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/weeds/index.html","Does your transgenic plant interbreed with a noxious weed in the immediate geographical region? For more information and a list of noxious weeds in California, please see pi.cdfa.ca.gov/weedinfo/","If “yes,” please describe the precautions taken to prevent interbreeding.",Are you planning to introduce transgenic plants to the field?,"If “yes,” please list any permits needed. For more information please see aphisweb.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/biotech/usergd.html#permit"
0,False,,False,The transgenic plants receive a disarmed T-DNA from Agrobacterium. This disarmed plasmid cannot induce grown gall disease. Transgenic plants may receive Cas9 and guide RNAs for CRISPR genome editing. The guide RNAs will be designed for specific plant sequences. The Cas9 can be removed through breeding.,False,False,False,,True,Transgenic maize and rice will be introduced into the field only using the appropriate APHIS permits. All UCR approval processes will be met.
