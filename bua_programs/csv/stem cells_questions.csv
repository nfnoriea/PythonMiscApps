0,"Stem cells will be handled in biosafety cabinets. Regular personal protective equipment including lab coats and gloves are required in all time. Should cells are accidentally spilled outside of the regular culture dishes, 10% bleaches will be applied for 10 minutes before wiping out with tissue papers. And disposals in contact with stem cell and media will be discarded in biosafety trash bins.","Stem cells will be handled in biosafety cabinets.

4,"All personnel will be trained (Biosafety/Bloodborne pathogen training) and wearing PPE (lab coat, safety glasses, gloves). Work will be performed in a BSL2 lab (Boyce hall 4413) and in a biosafety cabinet that will be disinfected before and after each use. Cell cultures will be maintained in HEPA-filtered CO2 incubators. Cultures will be routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. All cell culture media will be decontaminated with 10% bleach and plastics will be autoclaved in red biohazard bags before disposal. After exiting the cell culture room lab coats will be changed and hands washed. Tainted lab coats will be disposed in bags in laundry hampers and professionally cleaned.","All personnel will be trained (Biosafety/Bloodborne pathogen training) and wearing PPE (lab coat, safety glasses, gloves).
