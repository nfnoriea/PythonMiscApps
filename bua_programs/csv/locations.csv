527,Insectary and Quarantine Facility,138,Room 138 is separated the main corridor by an entryway anteroom. This anteroom has a UV light to attract and kill flying insects. Room 138 will contain insect growth incubators for raising transgenic whiteflies. There will be a yellow sticky cards in room ; yellow is attractive to whiteflies and this will remove any escapees.,3/14/2017,20170018
528,Insectary and Quarantine Facility,"352, 353 and 341","We will maintain B. tabaci Q (MED1)colonies in room 352; plants are maintained in bugdorms. We will perform B. tabaci Q infestations of alfalfa in room 353 plants are maintained in bugdorms. Once adults are removed from plants, infested alfalfa plants with immobile nymphs will be transferred to the adjacent quarantine greenhouse; plants are maintained in bugdorms. 341 is a laboratory. We will photograph infested leaves in this lab at the end of the experiment.",3/14/2017,20170018
