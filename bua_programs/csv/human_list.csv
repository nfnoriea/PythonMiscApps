113,human Neural crest cells derived from human iPSC or from hESC,"Chick embryos from early balstula (un-incubated) to late neurula (younger than 6 days of development). NOTE: We would like to inject hNCC derived from hESC or iPSC into chick embryos. According to NIH guidelines, the chick embryo is not classified as a vertebrate until it hatches(after 21 days of incubation/development). Our experiments only consider short term development from 12 hours to 6 days, after injecting into embryos between 0 and 6 days of development. This approach is clearly short of the 21 days required for a chick to hatch. We do not intend to push the development of these chimeras to term, and under no circumstance do I envision chimeras reaching 10 days of development. The grafts will be implanted into prospective neural crest territory (neural plate border, neural folds, and branchial arches, or craniofacial structures) of chick embryos. We hope to be able to follow the contribution of injected cells using a variety of markers. The number of cells to be used will be modified according to first hand experience. I would like to state that many papers using similar strategies to derive human neural crest cells have implanted them into chick embryos. These studies used the same cells we are using from the Wi Cell Research Institute. Please find below some examples of articles reporting results with these strategies: Jiang, X., et al., Isolation and characterization of neural crest stem cells derived from in vitro-differentiated human embryonic stem cells. Stem Cells Dev, 2009. 18(7): p. 1059-70. Bajpai, R., et al., CHD7 cooperates with PBAF to control multipotent neural crest formation. Nature, 2010. 463(7283): p. 958-62.
