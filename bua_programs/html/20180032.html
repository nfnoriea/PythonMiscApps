<tr>   <td class="TDBlue">Alteration or loss of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most frequent lesion detected in cancer. Our research projects focus on the molecular mechanisms by which cells regulate p53 transcriptional activity in response to DNA damage. The p53 tumor suppressor protein plays an important role in the cellular response to stress such as DNA damage. The biochemical activity of p53 that is required for this relies on its ability to bind to specific DNA sequences and to function as a transcription factor . Recently, we identified Thr-55 as a novel phosphorylation site on human p53 and showed that TAFI, the largest subunit of transcription factor TFIID complex, is responsible for the phosphorylation. TAFI is identical to CCG1, a cell cycle regulatory protein important for progression through the G1 phase and apoptosis. We observed that the phosphorylation of Thr55 by TAFI results in p53 degradation and leads to a decrease in G1 arrest. Importantly, the Thr55 phosphorylation was much reduced following DNA damage, which suggests that this phosphorylation contributes to the stabilization of p53 in response to DNA damage. Thus, phosphorylation by TAFI and the resultant destabilization of p53 provide a novel mechanism for regulation of the cell cycle in response to DNA damage. We propose to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which TAFI regulates the stability of p53 in response to DNA damage. First, we will identify the domains of TAFI required for p53 interaction and phosphorylation and we will examine whether TAFI double bromodomains (DBrD) are required for the interaction. Second, we will further characterize the role of Thr55 phosphorylation in TAFI-mediated cell G1 progression and apoptosis. Third, as p53 is a DNA-bound transcription activator and TAFI is a component of general transcription machinery, we will examine whether phosphorylation of p53 by TAFI occurs during the act of transcription. Fourth, we will define the underlying molecular mechanisms of Thr55 </td>
