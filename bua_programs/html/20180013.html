</tr>
<tr>   <td class="TDBlue">The project's overall goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of photosynthetic O2 production.  This process is catalyzed by the Mn4CaO5 cluster in Photosystem II and provides nearly our entire supply of atmospheric oxygen.  The Mn4CaO5 cluster accumulates oxidizing equivalents in response to light-driven photochemical events within Photosystem II and then oxidizes two molecules of water to oxygen in the final step of a five-step cycle.  Water oxidation is an extremely difficult chemical reaction, both thermodynamically and kinetically, yet the Mn4Ca cluster catalyzes this reaction far more efficiently than any synthetic catalyst.  The reason is that nature carefully designed the protein environment of the Mn4CaO5 cluster.  This environment controls the cluster's reactivity at each step in the catalytic cycle by carefully choreographing the proton and electron transfer reactions associated with water oxidation and by carefully managing both substrate (water) access and proton egress.  The project's primary goal is to identify the amino acid residues that are responsible for this control and to determine the role of each.  This information is crucial to understanding the mechanism of O2 production in Photosystem II and will complement information that is being obtained from X-ray crystallography.  The project&#146;s primary investigative tool is infrared (IR) spectroscopy.  The project&#146;s primary aims are to further delineate the dominant water access and proton egress pathways that link the Mn4CaO5 cluster with the thylakoid lumen and to characterize the influence of specific residues on the water molecules that serve as substrate or as participants in the networks of hydrogen bonds that make up the water access and proton egress pathways.  Both FTIR difference spectroscopy and time-resolved IR spectroscopy are being conducted with mutant Photosystem II core complexes representing residues identified crystallographically or computationally as potentially participating in networks of hydrogen bonds or otherwise interacting with the Mn4CaO5 cluster and the water molecules in its immediate environment.  Identifying these residues and further delineating the networks of hydrogen bonds that form water access and proton egress channels will improve our understanding of the dynamic mechanism of water oxidation by the Mn4CaO5 catalyst in PSII and will provide insight into the design of new generations of synthetic catalysts that convert sunlight into useful forms of storable energy. </td>

<tr>   <th class="THBlue">What are the specific objectives of the work with biohazardous materials?</th>
</tr>
<tr>   <td class="TDBlue">The environment of the manganese cluster in Photosystem II is made up of amino acid residues from two specific polypeptide chains.  To determine the role of a specific residue (e.g., Aspartate-170 of the D1 polypeptide), this residue is changed (e.g., Aspartate-170 is changed to Histidine) by site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding gene.  The mutation-bearing Photosystem II complexes are purified and characterized spectroscopically. We are also planning to overexpress the dorC gene (encoding a membrane-associated pentaheme protein) of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides in a strain of this organism that has been engineered for the overexpression of membrane proteins.  </td>
