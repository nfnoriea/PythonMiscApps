<tr>   <td class="TDBlue">We are interested in how changes in gene function during the course of plant evolution have produced changes in plant form and function.  Our focus is on flower and fruit diversity and the evolutionary changes in the genes that determine flower and fruit morphology.  Our work centers on two closely related plant development genes, AP1 and FUL.  In Arabidopsis, both are required for proper flower development, but AP1 is also required for sepals and petals to form, whereas FUL is important in the development of the dry capsule-like fruit of Arabidopsis. AP1 and FUL arose from a gene duplication, and although their sequences are similar, there are short amino acid motifs that distinguish them, and their expression patterns are different.  We are interested in whether the observed differences in function are the result of the different amino acid motifs or the differences in expression. We will be growing transgenic Arabidopsis (produced in another lab) which contain constructs with mutations that disrupt the amino acid motifs or that alter gene expression to answer this question. We may also make crosses with other Arabidopsis mutants.  We are also investigating the role of FUL genes in fruit development in the tomato family. Many members of this family produce seeds in a dry pod-like fruit whereas others produce a fleshy edible fruit.  We are interested in the role of changes in FUL function in the development of dry and fleshy fruit and will be comparing gene function in tomato and desert tobacco, which has a capsule-type fruit.  These species both have four copies of the FUL gene; to investigate the origin of all these copies we are amplifying FUL genes from a variety of species in the family, from the earliest diverging members to the most advanced, and are cloning them into E. coli for sequencing.  We will be looking at the number of genes as well as their sequences, to determine if any of the four groups of FUL genes has evolved more slowly or quickly.  We will also be using agrobacterium-mediated CRISPR technology to knock out each gene individually (four in tomato, four in desert tobacco) using a tissue-culture process.  The four genes fall into two pairs, euFULI and euFULII, and we will either use CRISPR or make crosses to make double mutants, and finally quadruple knock-outs. The goal is to determine if there are functional differences between euFULI and euFULII genes, and to determine if there are redundant functions that can only be uncovered if all are knocked out.  Our goal is to understand how changes in FUL function may have contributed to the evolution of fleshy fruit from dry fruit in this family. </td>

<tr>   <th class="THBlue">What are the specific objectives of the work with biohazardous materials?</th>
</tr>
<tr>   <td class="TDBlue">None of the materials are particularly hazardous, but the goals are:
(1) transgenic E. coli - our procedure to amplify FUL genes from tomato-family members will produce product containing multiple different gene sequences. To separate these and identify the ones relevant for us, we will clone the amplification product into E. coli and sequence plasmids that may contain a FUL gene.  We will use these sequences in analyses to identify when duplications occurred, and to analyze sequence evolution. This may help us determine that specific groups of FUL genes may have undergone functional changes, or that changes in gene sequence are correlated with the origin of fleshy fruit from dry fruit. (2) transgenic Agrobacterium - will be generated to introduce CRISPR-Cas9 constructs into tomato and desert tobacco to knock out the function of FUL genes to characterize their function in fruit and flower development. (3) transgenic tomato and desert tobacco - we will be using CRISPR to knock out each of the four FUL genes separately, and will also look at double and quadruple mutants.  (4) transgenic Datura - we are working on developing a transformation system for this species, which independently evolved a dry fruit, to expand the scope of our study.  We will characterize the function of FUL genes in dry and fleshy fruit development, which will help elucidate how fleshy fruit, which are economically and ecologically important, arose from dry fruit during the course of the evolution of the tomato family. Fleshy fruit have evolved from dry fruit many times in many plant families, and this work will contribute to a greater understanding of the mechanisms by which this occurred.  Potentially, the project will identify gene functions relevant for plant breeding or engineering.</td>
