<tr>   <td class="TDBlue">We propose to isolate and identify the toxicants in smoke and electronic cigarette aerosol that impair normal embryonic survival and development.   Once the dominant toxicants are identified,we will conduct dose response experiments with individual toxicants to determine which are most detrimental.  We will also determine at what concentration each toxicant produces an effect. 

 
 
We will also use human embryonic stem cells to develop  assays to evaluate the toxicity of cigarette smoke on mouse and human embryonic stem cell growth and differentiation.
Work with human subjects will involve collecting electronic cigarette aerosol exhalation for analysis of chemical exposure related to the use of these devices.

The specific aim of this project is to derive human embryonic stem cells (HESCs) at earlier stages of
development, then the currently existing HESCs, which have been derived from the internal cell mass (ICM) of
the blastocysts. Currently existing HESCs are already primed to differentiate to a particular lineage. (They are
called primed HESCs.) This impedes the use of existing HESCs for consistent differentiation to lineages of all
three germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm). In addition, it increases the cost for establishing a
specific differentiation protocols for each line. Our goal is to isolate na&#239;ve (ground state) pluripotent stem cells
that could show uniform propensity for differentiation to all tree germ layers.

Each year a graduate student level class will be taught in culturing of pluripotent stem cell lines.

Viruses (third generation lentiviruses) will be used to transfect cultured cells with various reporters. Addgene names are #12251 (packaging vector); Addgene #19319 (transfer vector) and Addgene #  12259  (envelope vector); Rev vector Addgene # 12253.

<tr>   <th class="THBlue">What are the specific objectives of the work with biohazardous materials?</th>
</tr>
<tr>   <td class="TDBlue">The objective is to determine which genes are up or down regulated in cultured  cells during exposure to cigarette smoke/aerosol.  
Specifically, we will grow hESC in culture and test tobacco constituents on their growth, survial and differentiation. We will also make transgenic stem cells using reporter genes that will enable us to follow in vitro differentiation .

Existing (primed) HESC lines contribute only to the three germ layers and they DO NOT contribute to the
placenta. We will also isolate HESCs that contribute to all three germ layers AND the placenta. Those cells may
show characteristics of human totipotent cells, which so far have not been isolated. Although induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) have emerged as a replacement of the HESCs, more research is needed in terms
of: &#149; their cell origin (somatic cells or adult stem/progenitor cells of the tissue of derivation); &#149;
reprogramming; &#149; potential tumorigenicity; &#149; iPSC-line to line response and efficiency of differentiation. A
better understanding of pluripotency, reprogramming and the signals for commitment to differentiation
requires more research. Therefore the derivation of more stable na&#239;ve HESC lines is important at this stage of
human embryonic stem cell research for the development of safe application of stem cells to the patient&#146;s bed
site.

The virally transfected cells will be used to monitor various reporters that deal with cell health and oxidative/metal stress. </td>
