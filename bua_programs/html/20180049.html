<tr>   <td class="TDBlue">Aluminum (Al) toxicity in acid soils is a global problem that severely limits crop growth and productivity. Significant work has focused on developing a basic knowledge of Al toxicity and resistance and at the same time devising schemes to modify crop plants to allow them to thrive in such an inhospitable environment, yet our understanding of the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying Al toxicity and resistance remain limited. Our work utilizes a previously described Al-sensitive Arabidopsis mutant, als3-1, to identify mutations that can be used to confer increases in Al resistance/tolerance. Since als3-1 has been found to have extreme negative responses to levels of Al that have no effect on growth of wild type roots, this mutant is a powerful tool to allow us to easily identify suppressor mutations that give increased Al resistance and to successfully use a map-based cloning approach to isolate the mutations of interest. We have undertaken an approach whereby als3-1 has been treated with the mutagenic agent EMS and M1 seedlings have been screened to identify mutants capable of sustaining wt or greater root growth in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of Al. From this approach, 15 confirmed strong alt (Al tolerant) mutants have been identified, with roots of these at the very least fully reversing the severe affects of Al toxicity on growth of als3-1. Of the 15 strong alt mutants, at least 9 of these have been found to represent dominant mutations, suggesting that these represent gain-of-function mutations that may positively affect a documented mechanism of Al resistance such as organic acid release, rhizosphere alkalinization, or Al sequestration. Our work focuses initially on cloning five of the alt mutations. Following isolation of the mutations, we will subsequently work to characterize the ALT genes with regard to their roles in Al resistance/tolerance using relevant biochemical, molecular, and physiological tools.
Additionally, our work has focused on identifying mutations that can increase Al resistance associated with malate release into the rhizosphere.  This has resulted in identification of multiple mutations that improve the function and activity of a key carbon fixation step in plants, Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase.  This enzyme is important to several processes including C4 photosynthesis and amino acid biosynthesis.  As part of our research to translate our findings into crop plants, our alr mutations will be introduced into PPC's found in maize in order to determine whether these will increase carbon fixation in the transgenic plants. </td>

<tr>   <td class="TDBlue">Some of the objectives of this work focus on cloning and characterization of the mutations of interest. Work will involved working with mutant plants, transgenic plants, engineered E. coli and engineered Agrobacterium tumafaciens. All genetically engineered organisms, both plant and microbial, will be disposed of properly by collecting and subsequently autoclaving them.
With regard to the maize work, transgenic plants will be generated in order to determine whether the introduced alr mutations can enhance PPC activity.  This will be measured through analysis of carbon fixation rates as well as rates of photosynthetic output, metabolic profiles and growth in aluminum toxic environments.  Engineered bacteria required for this project will be taken care of following normal procedures including work in appropriate locations and use of necessary decontamination techniques.  Transgenic maize plants will be housed in appropriate BSL-2 facilities including the PTRC and the Larsen laboratory in Boyce 3470.  Both locations are secured and transgenic plants will be properly disposed of following experimentation through the use of an autoclave.</td>
