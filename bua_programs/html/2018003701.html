<tr>   <td class="TDBlue">This project seeks to define the mechanism underlying interactions between the commensal gut microbiome and human pathogens, especially the diarrheal pathogen Vibrio cholerae. These studies will involve the culturing of commensal microbiota strains in aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and assembly into defined communities for introduction into germ-free mice. The ability of V. cholerae strains to invade these communities, both of V. cholerae wild-type and mutants in quorum signaling and pathogenesis regulator pathways, will then be assessed. V. cholerae colonization will be measured by dilution plating and CFU counting from fecal samples collected from infected animals. The ability of commensal isolates to produce or process molecules important for regulating V. cholerae pathogenesis will also be measured through biological reporter assays in which supernatants from commensal isolates are added to Vibrio reporter strains, or experiments in which V. cholerae is co-cultured with commensal bacteria. Levels of signaling molecules of interested in infected animals will be assayed by reporter measurements of tissue homogenates, mass spectroscopy, ELISA, or in vitro colorimetric or enzymatic assays. Interactions of microbiomes and Vibrio in vivo will be assayed by colonizing conventional, antibiotic treated conventional, and germ-free mice with different communities of commensal microbes, infecting these animals with V. cholerae, and measuring pathogen colonization, gene expression, and host physiological, immunological, and transcriptional changes as readouts.</td>

<tr>   <th class="THBlue">What are the specific objectives of the work with biohazardous materials?</th>
</tr>
<tr>   <td class="TDBlue">The work with biohazardous materials involves direct measurement of the colonization potential of the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae in the presence of specific members of the human gut microbiome and host responses to microbiome, diet, and infection. The ultimate goal is to identify specific genes in V. cholerae that contribute to pathogenesis but are modified in function by products of the gut microbiota. Such studies will necessarily involve V. cholerae with mutations in genes that contribute to virulence, such as those related to metabolism, cell signaling, motility, gene regulation, and virulence factor production. The role of specific V. cholerae genes and human microbiomes in commensal-pathogen interactions will be tested by assembling communities of bacteria in germ-free mice and infecting animals with wild-type or mutant V. cholerae. Tissues and fecal material will be taken from infected animals, and the levels of V. cholerae and microbial gene expression assessed in the lab.

These studies include establishing defined and undefined human gut microbiomes from human donors in mice. This involves the isolation in pure culture of commensal species from human fecal samples, to obtain "wild" isolates of gut microbes to test in germfree animals. Alternatively, human microbiomes will be established in mice through inoculation with suspensions of human fecal samples from healthy (uninfected) donors. </td>

V. cholerae is the etiologic agent of the diarrheal disease cholera. Transmission is oral, and highly dependent on consumption of food or use of agents that raise stomach pH. Minimum infectious dose is increased by many orders of magnitude when stomach pH is normal, or food is not consumed with inoculum (10^4 CFU with bicarbonate or food vs 10^8 CFU in buffered saline).

Human gut microbiomes are comprised of hundreds of commensal bacterial species. Material for this project will be collected from healthy individuals, and are not expected to contain infectious microorganisms. However, such samples are necessarily undefined without additional work in the laboratory.</td>

V. cholerae is naturally resistant to some antibiotics, but generally resistance to antibiotics does not dramatically influence the course of disease. By far the most important element of treatment cholera consists of rehydration therapy. While oral antibiotics may be given at the start of treatment, such drugs do not eliminate the diarrheal symptoms. As such, addition of abx resistance to V. cholerae is not expected to greatly increase the risks of the organism to humans in the event of accidental release.

V. cholerae is an aquatic microorganism. Outside of human hosts, the organism is found on biotic surfaces in brackish water, such as the exoskeletons of planktonic organisms in estuarine/coastal water.</td>
