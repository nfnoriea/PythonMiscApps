<tr>   <td class="TDBlue">Establishment of proper connections in the developing brain is essential for perception, language, thought, consciousness, learning and memory. Accurate cell migration, axon guidance, synapse formation and subsequent pruning of exuberant neuronal projections are indispensable for the development of a functional nervous system. Disruption of any of these processes can result in a range of neurodevelopmental disorders including schizophrenia, autism, epilepsy, and neuronal degeneration. We have previously identified several genes that participate in neural circuit assembly and refinement. Using a variety of transgenic mice and surgical manipulations, our studies seek to unravel the biological function of these specific genes during normal nervous system development, as well as their contribution to neurodevelopmental disorders.

We will use recombinant DNA, and replication deficient adeno-associated viruses and  lentiviruses to explore the molecular underpinings of neural development. The use of these tools will be an essential part of our work. </td>
