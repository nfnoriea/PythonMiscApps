It is important to develop a means to manipulate astrocyte volume selectively in our brain tissue slices. Current techniques may not be selective for astrocytes, clouding interpretation of data. Optogenetics may provide a means to manipulate astrocyte volume selectively and with precise temporal and spatial control.</td>

<tr>   <td class="TDBlue">We will use recombinant DNA and replication deficient adenoassociated
viruses (AAVs) to drive expression of ion channels only in astrocytes. Stimulation of ion influx into astrocytes may be associated with an astrocyte-specific water influx, thereby causing astrocyte swelling selectively. 
Injection of AAV constructs will take place in the Riccomagno Laboratory, room 1215 Biological Sciences. The Riccomagno lab is approved to perform these injections as per their AUP. After injection of the pups at P5, the animals will be returned to care from their mother and housed in the Boyce Hall vivarium until used for experiments beginning 2 weeks after injection. Pups will be moved individually to the Fiacco Lab (room 1210) to perform imaging and optogenetics experiments in hippocampal slices as detailed in the Fiacco Lab AUP and SOP. </td>
