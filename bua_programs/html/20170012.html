Field growth will allow us to generate enough seed to perform experiments during the rest of the year. More importantly, there is not enough space in the greenhouse to propagate all the lines needed for our research. The purpose of the project is to study cell division in plants using fluorescent marker proteins. Plants will be destroyed by autoclaving to eliminate threat to the environment. All plants grown in the field will be covered with shoot bags and devitalized after use, as described in APHIS approved SOP documents, to prevent release of transgenic materials into the environment. </td>

<tr>   <th class="THBlue"> If &#8220;yes&#8221;, list your recommendations.</th>   <td class="TDBlue">The NIH guidelines are followed for procedures involving recombinant bacteria. Transgenic plant material is limited to growth chambers and greenhouses, and is defined as BL1-P according to Section III E 2 a in the NIH guidelines. Greenhouse practices follow standard operating procedures including restricting access via keyed entry, records of experiments, greenhouse practices and elimination of transgenic plants by autoclaving as described in Appendix P-II-A of the NIH guidelines. All recombinant material is autoclaved before disposal.

Our approved design protocol for the field is below.

Design Protocols for Field Tests
Dr. Carolyn Rasmussen
University of California, Riverside

Performance standards as defined in APHIS form 7CFR340 will be followed.  Standards for shipping, receiving, storage, and field release of transgenic materials will be as described.

1. Plant materials (i.e., GE corn) are packaged in labeled seed envelopes in labeled plastic self-locking boxes to ensure that plant materials will not be released during transit.

2. Plants are grown in field plots that are isolated from any other cornfields by a distance of 660 feet. Field stakes around the site delimit the planting area. All seeds transported are planted on the day of transport. Planting is carried out using a jab planter, which is monitored at the end of each row to verify proper seed planting. Weeding is done by hand with hand-held hoes. Weeding and hoeing equipment is cleaned on site after use to ensure there will not be a transfer of seeds. All field assistants are required to read the design protocols. The supervisor, Dr. Carolyn Rasmussen, monitors field assistant&#146;s actions to ensure compliance. Control of pollen movement is discussed under item 5 below.

3. The transgenic corn plots are isolated from other cornfields in the surrounding area. There are no cornfields within 660 feet of the field space. All rows consisting of 20 kernels each are labeled with family number. </td>
