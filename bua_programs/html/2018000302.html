<tr>   <td class="TDBlue">Neural crest cells (NC) contribute to a wide range of derivatives including neurons and glia of the peripheral nervous system and melanocytes of the skin, and a wealth of craniofacial derivatives, including tooth forming cells, bone and cartilage. Aberrant NC development is responsible for many human pathologies. The purpose of this project is to reveal basic principles of NC development in avian and rabbit embryos and in a model of human NC development. We will pinpoint the role(s) of known and novel players in the origin and differentiation of neural crest cells. Additionally we will model specific mutations of genes involved in cleft lip and/or palate, and we will assess their effects in survival, proliferation, expression and differentiation of neural crest derivatives.

<tr>   <td class="TDBlue">We have developed a unique model of human Neural crest cells based in hESCs. We will take advantage of this model to identify novel components of the gene regulatory network controlling the origin and differentiation potential of neural crest cells. We will determine the role of known and novel putative-components of this gene regulatory network. We will assess the signaling requirements for human neural crest formation and differentiation. In particular we will tackle BMP, FGF, Wnt, Insulin, and Retinoid signaling pathways amongst others. We aim to determine their time of operation, their transcriptional effectors and their targets. An additional goal of this project is to establish the ontogeny of human neural crest cells. To this end specific lineages will be induced or inhibited while monitoring specific effects on neural crest formation/differentiation.
We will also address the heterogeneity and pluripotency of neural crest cells based on transcription factor expression profiles. Finally, we will develop a platform of assays to address the currently unknown effects of known mutations involved in craniofacial malformations like cleft lip and/or cleft palate. These assays will allow us to determine the specific effects altered by such mutations (proliferation, survival, differentiation, integration, etc).

NOTE: We would like to inject hNCC derived from hESC or iPSC into chick embryos. According to NIH guidelines, the chick embryo is not classified as a vertebrate until it hatches(after 21 days of incubation/development). Our experiments only consider short term development from 12 hours to 6 days, after injecting into embryos between 0 and 6 days of development. This approach is clearly short of the 21 days required for a chick to hatch. We do not intend to push the development of these chimeras to term, and under no circumstance do I envision chimeras reaching 10 days of development. The grafts will be implanted into prospective neural crest territory (neural plate border, neural folds, and branchial arches, or craniofacial structures) of chick embryos. We hope to be able to follow the contribution of injected cells using a variety of markers. The number of cells to be used will be modified according to first hand experience. I would like to state that many papers using similar strategies to derive human neural crest cells have implanted them into chick embryos. These studies used the same cells we are using from the Wi Cell Research Institute.
