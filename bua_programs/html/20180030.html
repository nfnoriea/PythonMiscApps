<tr>   <td class="TDBlue">Our research focuses on fundamental questions concerning the genetic composition and biology of virus, as well as virus-host interaction. Currently we are using influenza virus as our model system. We applied molecular biological techniques to understand how viruses replicate and how they interact with cells to cause disease in their hosts. 
(The influenza related work will be performed in Boyce Hall 4478, which has two bio safety cabinets (Cellgrad ES Class II, Type A2)).     

 
Another emphasize of the research is to understand the replication of ZIKV(ZIKA virus) in mammalian cell culture.  
(The ZIKV related work will be performed in Boyce Hall 4478, which has two bio safety cabinets (Cellgrad ES Class II, Type A2)) since there is no insect related research in our neighbor labs. Originally, Dr. Omar was my neighbor lab and he was working on mosquito. His lab has permanently moved out and his space was been thoroughly decontaminated under the supervision of the Chair of the department of entomology; Dr. Richard Redak.)    </td>

<tr>   <th class="THBlue">What are the specific objectives of the work with biohazardous materials?</th>
</tr>
<tr>   <td class="TDBlue">Working with influenza viruses, it will allow us to achieve the following objectives:

1. We can understand the impact of viral genes and their products to the viral pathogenicity. 

2. We will identify the intra-cellular proteins that interact with viral encoded proteins. The understanding will not only facilitate us to understand how they contribute to viral infection but also help us to gain better understanding of their biological function in cells. 

3. We will attempt to generate optimized influenza vaccine. 

The ultimate goal of our research is to enable us to better prepare for future influenza virus infection. 
Investigating ZKIV replication in cell culture systems and mice. It will enable us to understand the differential replication kinetics of ZIKV in different cell culture systems. This study supply vital information for further understanding its replication characters. In addition, it supplied an important tool for evaluating efficacy of screening antivirals.  </td>

For Zika virus: 
ZIKV can be transmitted through the blood from needle stick injuries. All workers are required to use proper PPE when handling the virus and infected animals will be handled in biosafety cabinets. Zika can also be transmitted through mosquitoes, however the presence of mosquitoes in the vivarium BSL2 room is highly unlikely. Additionally, mice are housed in closed filter-top cages. Investigators, not animal staff, will handle the cages to reduce risk of exposure to mosquitoes. Virus related work will be conducted in the biosafety cabinet to prevent exposure to any potential mosquito. All needles exposed to the virus will be disposed in a biohazard sharp contain</td>

Thus, it is not useful for yearly medical surveillance. Rather, personnel will fill a form before handling ZIKV and in case of suspected exposure.
